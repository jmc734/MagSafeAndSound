MagSafeAndSound
===============

The MagSafe connector is a great improvement over traditional notebook power adapter connectors but has introduced a new problem, at least for me. When using my MacBook Air on my lap or on a soft surface like a comforter, the connector tends to get disconnected because it has no real support in the vertical direction due to the profile of the machine.

To get around this issue, I designed and 3d-printed a dongle to go over the MagSafe connector and anchor it to the adjacent USB port. It should be noted though that while this solves the disconnecting issue, it does **put the cable and USB port at risk of damage** if the cord in yanked on or tripped over.

DWG and STL files for the design are provided as well as GCODE generated for the [Ultimaker 2](https://ultimaker.com) using [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software). 

### Printing Note:
The dongle is printed with the USB portion pointing up from the print bed. This allows the design to be printed without supports but does result is some creepage at the base where the cable and strap holes are. I ended up having to file away a small amount of material around the cable hole to allow it to fit the cable easily. In future iterations, I will likely increase the tolerances a bit.
